# 🔍 Automated Vulnerability Scanner

## 📌 Project Overview

**Automated Vulnerability Scanner** is cybersecurity tool, for scanning systems you have for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, services and web applications. It leverages powerful open-source tools such as **Nmap**, **NSE Scripts**, **Nikto** and **OpenVAS** to detect security flaws and create reports with references for Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures (CVE) and suggested remediations.

With this project, organizations or individuals can easily find the security issues and fix them **before attackers exploiting it**.

## 📌 Project Summary

This project is an **Automated Vulnerability Scanner** that scans networks, servers, and web applications for known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Using tools like **Nmap**, **OpenVAS**, or **Nessus**, it identifies security issues, maps them to CVEs, and suggests remediation steps. It works both **online** (for real-time CVE data) and **offline** environments.
